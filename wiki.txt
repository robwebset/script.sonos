== Introduction ==
The Kodi Sonos addon allows you to control your Sonos system from Kodi. It is implemented (for those who like to know) as a script, plugin and service. In addition to controlling your Sonos system it also allows you to be notified (via a popup) whenever a new track starts and link the audio volume control of Kodi to the audio volume of the Sonos system. There is also a full "Artist View" controller that will display images and descriptions of the artists currently playing on the Sonos System.
<br />
<br />
== Sonos Controller ==
The Sonos Controller can be launched in two different ways:
* From Programs -> Sonos
* From the Browser Menu (See below)

There are two different formats of controller. They both offer the same expected features:

* Display Artist Name
* Display Track Name
* Display Album Name
* Display Album Artwork
* Display Track Duration and Current Position
* Volume Display and Operations (Mute, Change Volume)
* Control Operations (Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Previous, Seek)
* Adjustment Operations (Loop, Random, Crossfade)

The standard controller supports just this set of features, and the data is read from the source files that the Sonos system is playing or streaming.

The advanced controllers will also support additional information which is retrieved from the internet. These are available when you enable the option "Display Artist Information" in the settings. These include:

| Slideshow Only (No Controller)
''Note:'' This screen works well if you also have Notifications enabled (with "Do Not Display Notification If Controller Is Showing" unset) so that you also get notified what the artist and title of each track that starts is.

== Notifications ==
The notifications option (if enabled) will display a small popup whenever the track being played by the Sonos system changes. This popup will display the Track Title, Artist and Album Artwork.
